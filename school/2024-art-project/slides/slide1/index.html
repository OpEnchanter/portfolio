        <h3>Yayoi Kusama's Life</h3>
        <p>Yayoi Kusama is a Japanese Woman born in March 22, 1929. When she was only a child, Kusama had suffered from constant hallucinations and potential schizophrenia. Being abused at a young age did not help at all. However, this would only fuel her creative interest. She would go on to enjoy painting, and after a small amount of training moved to the U.S. to pursue her career of painting and creating artwork. Unfortunately, by choice she eventually moved to a mental hospital where, at the age of 95 she continues to create artwork.</p>
